# Sxlib-Open-Source-UI
I figured that alot of people are struggling to make their own synapse UI So I made this so you can copy + paste code. Enjoy!
Oh, look I even included the dll for you.
# Important
Whoever wants to use sxlib has to own Synapse X!
# Use
Put the exe in the folder that you use Synapse X.
